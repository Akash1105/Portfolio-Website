        <div class="about-section">
            <h2>Past Experience</h2>
            <p>I have worked as a software engineer at Cerner Corporation. During my internship at Cerner, I contributed to building and optimizing web applications and services in the healthcare domain. I worked on the development of a platform that enabled company employees to post appreciation messages using React.js, Node.js, and Express, collaborating closely with a team to integrate frontend and backend functionality. I also wrote comprehensive unit tests with Jest, achieving 90% code coverage, ensuring robust and reliable applications.

                In my second role, I worked with a diverse tech stack, including Ruby on Rails, Java, and AWS services like EMR and S3. I was involved in optimizing algorithms for diagnostic tools and played a key role in migrating microservices from Java 8 to Java 11. Additionally, I led the development of automation tests using Playwright and supported the migration of services to Kubernetes.</p>

            <h2>Current Endeavors</h2>
            <p>Currently, I am pursuing a graduate degree at Northeastern University, focusing on advanced software development. At Northeastern University, I have taken on multiple leadership roles that reflect my commitment to student engagement, support, and community building. As a Graduate Teaching Assistant, I help over 170 students understand cloud computing principles, leading to notable improvements in their academic performance. Through weekly office hours, I provide personalized support, fostering practical understanding of cloud technologies.

                In my role as Global Recreation Brand Ambassador, I spearhead the planning and execution of campus-wide recreational events, managing budgets and resources to increase participation by 40%. I also design and implement marketing campaigns that enhance engagement and satisfaction among students.
                
                Additionally, as the Founder of the Arlington Explorers’ Society, I lead a student-driven initiative that organizes outdoor events to encourage wellness and foster connections. By managing event logistics and budgets, I’ve grown participation by 30%, promoting both physical and social well-being among my peers.</p>

            <h2>Interests</h2>
            <p>I am passionate about technology, education, and community engagement. As a graduate student in Computer Science, I am constantly exploring innovative solutions to real-world problems, especially in the fields of cloud computing, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. My technical curiosity drives me to continuously learn and apply new technologies, both in academic and professional settings.

                Beyond my academic interests, I am deeply committed to fostering a sense of community. As a Global Recreation Brand Ambassador and the founder of the Arlington Explorers’ Society, I’ve learned how vital physical well-being and connection are to student life. I enjoy organizing events that promote wellness, teamwork, and stress relief, helping students build meaningful connections outside the classroom.
                
                I am also passionate about outdoor activities like hiking, exploring nature, and participating in sports, as they offer a perfect balance to my tech-focused academic pursuits. These activities help me maintain a healthy work-life balance and provide fresh perspectives for creative problem-solving.</p>
